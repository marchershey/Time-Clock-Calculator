## v1.0.0 - Initial Release

- **Initial Release Features**
  - Simple one-page calculator to calculate the exact amount of hours worked by inputing the clock in and out times. 
  - **jQuery Timepicker** - I chose this plugin because I really like the 'auto-complete?' feature it has. You can simply type `430` and it will correct it to `04:30`. Same goes for PM; you can type `430p`, and it will correct it to `16:30`. I feel that will come quite in handy.
